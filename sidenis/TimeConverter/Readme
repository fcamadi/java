We would like to ask you to implement a converter between usual time representation and Berlin one.
To do that task you have to realize what is the Berlin Clock .

The Berlin Clock is based on the principles of quantity didactics and
with this its the first of its kind. The time is calculated by adding
the lit rectangular lamps. The top lamp is a pump which is blinking on/off every two seconds.
In the upper line of red lamps every lamp represents 5 hours.
In the lower line of red lamps every lamp represents 1 hour.
So if in the first line 2 lamps are lit and in the second line 3 lamps its 5+5+3=13h
or 1 p.m. In the third line with tall lamps every lamp represents 5 minutes.
There are 11 lamps, the 3rd, 6th, and 9th are red indicating the first quarter, half,
and the last quarter of the hour. In the last line with yellow lamps every lamp represents
1 minute.

As we have already mentioned you need to write the converter. It should implement interface TimeConverter
and pass all tests which are in place.

So what the game rules are?

1) Imagine that the application you are going to write is not just a simple task,
but a complex application which you will maintain for years. It should be designed well, it has to be
supportable. You have to be proud of making it in this way. The coming changes should be done easily.

We encourage you to follow SOLID principles.

2) The second point is that you have to write tests on your code.

3) Your code should be narrative and please keep it simple.
